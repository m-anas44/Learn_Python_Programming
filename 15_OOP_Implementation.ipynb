    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "In Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows for the creation of classes and objects, which provide a clear and efficient way to structure code. This lecture focuses on how to implement the core OOP concepts, such as classes, attributes, methods, and objects, with real-life examples and practical coding implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points**\n",
    "1. **Understanding Classes and Objects**\n",
    "   - **Class:** A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (characteristics) and methods (behaviors) that objects created from the class will possess.\n",
    "   - **Object:** An object is an instance of a class. It is a specific realization of the class with defined values for its attributes.\n",
    "   - **Example:** If we define a class House, we can create multiple objects, each representing a specific house with unique attributes like color, size, and area.\n",
    "2. **The` __init__` Method (Constructor)**\n",
    "   - The `__init__` method is a constructor in Python, used to initialize the attributes of an object when it is created. This method is automatically called when an object is instantiated from a class.\n",
    "   - **Example:** In the House class, we define the attributes of color and size in the` __init__` method. When an object of House is created, these attributes are automatically set.\n",
    "3. **Attributes and Their Initialization**\n",
    "   - **Attributes:** These are characteristics that define the object. For example, the color, size, and area of a house are attributes.\n",
    "   - Attributes are defined inside the `__init__` method using the **self** keyword, which refers to the current instance of the class.\n",
    "   - **Example:** `self.color = color` links the value passed to the color parameter with the object's color attribute.\n",
    "4. **Methods in OOP**\n",
    "   - **Methods:** Methods define the behavior of an object. They are functions that belong to the class and are used to manipulate or access the object's attributes.\n",
    "   - **Example:** A Car class might have methods like start() and stop() to control the carâ€™s actions. In the case of the House class, you can define methods like paint() or renovate() to change its attributes.\n",
    "5. **Creating Objects and Accessing Attributes**\n",
    "   - Once a class is defined, you can create objects (instances) from it. Each object has its own set of attributes that can be accessed and modified.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   my_house = House(\"Blue\", \"Large\")\n",
    "   print(my_house.color)  # Outputs: Blue\n",
    "   print(my_house.size)   # Outputs: Large\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Practical Example: Defining a House Class**\n",
    "**Defining the Class**\n",
    "   - To define a class in Python, use the class keyword followed by the class name. The class will contain the __init__ method to initialize its attributes.\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      class House:\n",
    "\n",
    "         def __init__(self, color, size):\n",
    "\n",
    "            self.color = color\n",
    "\n",
    "            self.size = size\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "**Instantiating the Object**\n",
    "   - After defining the class, you can create an object from it by calling the class as if it were a function.\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      my_house = House(\"Blue\", \"Large\")\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "**Accessing Attributes**\n",
    "   - To access the attributes of the object, use the dot notation.\n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      print(my_house.color)  # Blue\n",
    "      print(my_house.size)   # Large\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Methods**\n",
    " - You can also define methods within the class to perform actions on the object's attributes.\n",
    " - **Example:**"
