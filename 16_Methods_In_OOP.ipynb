    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "This lecture focuses on methods in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python. It builds on the concepts of classes and instances, explaining how methods allow interaction with and modification of objects created from blueprints (classes). The session covers the three primary types of methods â€” **instance methods**, **class methods**, and **static methods** â€” with practical examples and explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Overview of Classes and Methods**\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint; instances (objects) are created based on this blueprint.\n",
    "- Example: If you design a blueprint for a house, you can build many houses (instances) from it.\n",
    "- Different instances may have different attributes (e.g., color).\n",
    "- To modify or interact with these attributes, methods are used inside the class.\n",
    "#### **2. Instance Methods**\n",
    "- Instance methods operate on individual instances of a class.\n",
    "- Defined with `def` inside a class, their first parameter is always `self`, referring to the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instance Methods = Methods Bound to an Instance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance methods are functions defined inside a class that operate on an instance of the class. They take `self` as their first parameter, which refers to the specific instance calling the method. These methods can access and modify the attributes of the instance and call other instance methods.\n",

    "- A static method is a method that belongs to a class but does not access or modify the class itself or any instance of the class. Unlike instance methods or class methods, static methods do not take `self` (the instance) or `cls` (the class) as their first parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Static methods behave like regular functions, but they are logically grouped inside a class because they perform operations relevant to the classâ€™s purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are typically used for utility tasks such as validations, calculations, or helper functions that donâ€™t rely on the state of the class or its instances.\n",
