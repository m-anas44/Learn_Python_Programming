    "### **Local Variables**\n",
    "Local variables are those defined within a function. They are only accessible within the function and cannot be accessed outside of it. To help visualize this, consider the example of a **classroom whiteboard**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classroom Whiteboard:** The content written on it can only be seen by those within the classroom during the session. This represents a local variable, as its scope is limited to that particular function (or classroom).\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    y = 5  # Local variable inside the function\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Inside function: x =\", x, \"y =\", y)\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 10  # Global variable outside the function\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()  # Calling the function\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, the function can access the global variable x but y can only be accessed within `my_function()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Global Variables**\n",
    "Global variables are defined outside of functions and are accessible throughout the entire program. In our analogy, the **school's notice board** can be seen by everyone in the school, not just those in a specific class. Similarly, a global variable can be accessed by any function in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "x = 10  # Global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    y = 5  # Local variable\n",
    "    print(\"Inside function: x =\", x, \"y =\", y)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()  # Calling the function\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Outside function: x =\", x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the variable `x` is global, so it can be accessed both inside and outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Practical Example: Local vs. Global Variables**\n",
    "In the example below, we try to access a global variable inside a function, which works fine. However, attempting to access a local variable outside the function results in an error because local variables are confined to the function's scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "x = 10  # Global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    y = 5  # Local variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"Inside function: x =\", x, \"y =\", y)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Outside function: x =\", x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trying to access the local variable 'y' outside the function will result in an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "# print(\"Outside function: y =\", y)  # This will give an error: name 'y' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Understanding Variable Scope**\n",
    "#### **Local Variables:**\n",
    "- Defined inside a function.\n",
    "- Only accessible within that function.\n",
    "#### **Global Variables:**\n",
    "- Defined outside any function.\n",
    "- Accessible from any part of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Nested Functions and Enclosing Variables**\n",
    "When one function is defined inside another, the variables of the inner function are considered **local** to that function. If a variable is defined in the outer function but is accessed by the inner function, it is called an **enclosing variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "x = 10  # Global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "def outer_function():\n",
    "    y = 5  # Enclosing variable\n",
    "    def inner_function():\n",
    "        z = 3  # Local variable\n",
    "        print(\"Inside inner function: x =\", x, \"y =\", y, \"z =\", z)\n",
    "\n",
    "    inner_function()\n",
    "\n",
    "outer_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Modifying Global Variables from Within Functions**\n",
    "To modify a global variable inside a function, we need to use the `global` keyword. Without this keyword, Python treats the variable as a local one within the function.\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "counter = 0  # Global variable\n",
    "def increment_counter():\n",
    "    global counter\n",
    "\n",
    "    counter += 1  # Modifying global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "increment_counter()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Counter value:\", counter)  # Output: Counter value: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Without the `global` keyword, the function would not be able to modify the global counter variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Comparing Memory Locations: `is` vs `==`**\n",
    "In Python, we can check if two variables refer to the same object in memory using the `is` operator, and we can check if their values are equal using `==`.\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Comparing values\n",
    "print(a == b)  # Output: True\n",
    "\n",
    "# Comparing memory locations\n",
    "print(a is b)  # Output: False\n",
    "```\n",
    "Even though the lists `a` and `b` have the same values, they are stored at different memory locations. Therefore, `a is b` returns `False`."
